# SQL Pirates

Python and SQL

This was a really fun project for me to build. This was one of my earlier projects in the backend section of Awesome Inc's bootcamp. I really enjoyed learning python. As a language, it just made a lot more sense to me to use indentation for blocks of code rather than braces.

Learning how databases worked was also a really eye-opening experience for me. Being able to achieve CRUD functionality with the pirates in my database was a very big challenge, but I really enjoyed making this project.

Also, if you like One Piece the anime this is definitely worth a look!

Please take a look and let me know if you have any advice/questions!
